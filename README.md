This repository contains my previous academic website I created using [jemdoc+MathJax](https://github.com/wsshin/jemdoc_mathjax).

This repository will not be updated anymore.  For many years I enjoyed using jemdoc+MathJax to manage my academic website, but there was a major limitation: it did not create a mobile-device-friendly website.  So, I decide to switch to a modern static site generator.  My choice is [`Franklin.jl`](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl), as Julia is my main programing language these days.
