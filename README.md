This is the jemdoc+MathJax script I used to create my previous academic website.  

This repository will not be updated anymore.  For many years I enjoyed using [jemdoc+MathJax](https://github.com/wsshin/jemdoc_mathjax) to manage my academic website, but there was a major limitation: it did not create a mobile-device-friendly website.  So, I decide to switch to a modern static site generator.  My choice is [`Franklin.jl`](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl), as Julia is my main programing language these days.
